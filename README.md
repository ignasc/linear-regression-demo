# Basic Linear Regression DEMO (Work in progress)
## Description

This is a basic linear regression algorithm demo written in javascript. It is still a work in progress with just bare bones and limited functionality, but it can be tested in action [here](https://ignasc.github.io/linear-regression-demo/), where you can find an interactive graph that generates random data points and lets you adjust theta0 and theta1 coeficients to fit a line that would represent those data points. You can then choose to activate linear regression algorithm and let it work out theta0 and theta1 and see how well you managed to fit your line, compared to calculated line.

## Features
- Ability to adjust Theta0 and Theta1 using bigger (for quick) and smaller (finetune) increments.
- Immediate feedback in the form of drawn line and calculated cost as you adjust sliders.
- Can generate new data points.

## Future plans
- Automatically reset finetune slider back to middle to you are not limited to min/max values when using that slider.
- Reset user line/sliders when generating new data.
- More user-friendly interface to use.
- Might add additional functionalities and expand on what is already built.
